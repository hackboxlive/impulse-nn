# impulse-nn

A artificial neural network library written in C++14, written from scratch. Currently, it trains on a feed-forward network, which to my surprise, works fine. The activating function here used is the fast sigmoid function, and the derivative function is also of the same.

## How to run?

Use the command `./impulse` to run the project. You can build the project by using `make` command while in the project directory.

(I don't know much about it :p)

## What did it teach me?

1. I knew about feed-forward neural nets. But never thought implementing them would be such a pain. A lot of hours in debugging taught me to write cleaner code.

2. I learned a great deal about how to write makefiles, which turns out to be pretty cool.

3. How to handle header files and link them to other files for communication.

## Furthur advancements

Reading about back propagation from here and there. Will try to implement as soon as I can.

Read the name tanh function somewhere, don't know what it is. Will try to know more about it.
